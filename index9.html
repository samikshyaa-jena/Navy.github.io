</p>
<h1>ADVENTURE / MOUNTAINEERING ACTIVITIES</h1>
<p>
<b>Mount Everest 2004</b>
An ascent of Mt Everest which stands at 8850 m is considered ultimate challenge in the mountaineering world. The Indian Navy embarked on an expedition to Mt Everest in 2004 taking the difficult North Face route via Tibet. The expedition was flagged off in a unique manner from the depths of the ocean by the-then honourable Raksha Mantri, Mr George Fernandes, on 08 Mar 2004 aboard INS Sindhuraj from a depth of 50 m. The Indian Navy team consisted of 13 members and five summited the peak over two days, 18 and 19 May 2004. It was the first all-Navy team to summit Everest in the world and also the first Indian Armed Forces ascent from the North Face, which is a national record.</p>

<h1>South Pole</h1>
<p>
The Indian Navy team skied to the geographic South Pole in 2006. The team skied a distance of about 250 km while manually pulling sleds weighing in excess of 100 kg. It took 10-12 hours of active skiing each day to reach the South Pole. Inaccessibility of region, inhospitable weather and terrain conditions and freezing temperatures added to the difficulties. The warmest temperature in the region was minus 35°C. While the ascension in height is 3200 meters at the South Pole, the effective altitude is around 3800 mtrs due to the thinner atmospheric layer and Ozone hole. Therefore, the team, in addition to all weather and terrain hazards, was also exposed to the high altitude zone of above 3000 mtrs. The team comprised of 10 members and they reached the geographic South Pole on 28 Dec 2006 at 0200 hrs (IST). The following records were established:-
<br><br>
First Indian Team to ski to South Pole.
First Indian Everest Summiteers to reach the South Pole.
First Armed Forces Team since 1912 to ski to South Pole.</p>
<h1>North Pole</h1>
<p>
A ten member team, once again led by Cdr Satyabrata Dam reached the geographic North Pole at 2016 hrs on 09 Apr 2008. The ten member team had to undergo rigorous training and physical as well as mental conditioning to take up this challenge. The journey was excruciating and difficult, and the weather was unfavourable on most of the days. The team overcame all hurdles with courage, determination and true grit. With the successful completion of the North Pole expedition the following records were established:-<br><br>

First organization in the world to reach all the 3 Poles.
First Indian team to ski to geographic North Pole.
First Indian team to ski to both poles.
First Indians to do all poles.<br><br>

<b>Mount Kamet Expedition (7756 M)</b>
A thirteen member team of the Eastern Naval Command undertook a challenging expedition to the twin peaks of Mt Kamet (7756 M) and Mt Abi Gamin (7355 M) in the Garhwal Himalayas from 09 May 16 to 11 Jun 16. The team has achieved unprecedented success by summiting both the peaks on 02 Jun 16 and 04 Jun 16 respectively. Mt Kamet, the third highest peak in India, is the highest peak open for mountaineering. Thus, the Naval Ensign has been planted at the highest point possible within the geographical boundary of the country.<br><br>

<b>Expedition to Mt Satopanth (7203 metre)</b>
A 12 member team led by Lt Cdr Vineet Doshi successfully summited Mt Satopanth (7077M) in Gangotri region on 17 Jun 16. The team had representation from all Naval Commands. Another unnamed peak (Pt 6020) in vicinity was also conquered by the team during the descent phase. </p>
